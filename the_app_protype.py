"""In this code, you will need to replace YOUR_SPOONACULAR_API_KEY, 
YOUR_EMAIL_ADDRESS, and YOUR_EMAIL_PASSWORD with your own API key and email credentials. 
You will also need to replace YOUR_RECIPIENT_EMAIL_ADDRESS with the email address that you want to receive the recipe notifications.

Note that this code will run continuously and send a new recipe to your email every hour. 
If you want to stop the program, you will need to manually terminate the script."""
