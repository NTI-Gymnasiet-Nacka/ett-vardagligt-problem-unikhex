Set up your development environment with Node.js and a suitable database such as MongoDB or MySQL:

Download and install Node.js from the official website (https://nodejs.org/en/).
Choose a database that suits your project requirements, such as MongoDB or MySQL. Install and configure the database server.
Create a backend server using Node.js with Express.js:

Initialize a new Node.js project using npm init command in the terminal.
Install Express.js package using npm install express command in the terminal.
Create a new server.js file in the root directory of the project.
Configure the server using Express.js and define the routes that will handle the incoming requests and send the responses back to the client.
Implement a notification system that sends notifications to users at a certain set time or with an interval:

Install the node-cron package using npm install node-cron command in the terminal.
Define a function that will handle the notification sending.
Set up a cron job using node-cron package to execute the function at a specific time or interval.
Implement a recipe API that retrieves recipes from Spoonacular or another recipe API:

Sign up for an account at Spoonacular and get the API key.
Use Axios package to make HTTP requests to the Spoonacular API and retrieve the recipes.
Define a route in the backend server that will handle the request to retrieve the recipes.
Build a frontend interface that allows users to view recipes and manage notifications:

Choose a frontend framework, such as React or Vue.js, and set it up in the project.
Build the user interface components that will display the recipes and notifications to the users.
Use Axios package to make requests to the backend server and retrieve the data to be displayed in the frontend.
Implement user authentication and authorization using packages like Passport.js:

Install Passport.js package using npm install passport command in the terminal.
Define the authentication and authorization middleware functions that will be used in the routes that require them.
Set up the authentication and authorization logic for the routes that require them.
Store user preferences and recipes in a database so that the backend can retrieve them when needed:

Define the database schema and models that will store the user preferences and recipes data.
Use the database package, such as Mongoose for MongoDB, to connect to the database and interact with it.
Implement the logic to store and retrieve the data from the database.
