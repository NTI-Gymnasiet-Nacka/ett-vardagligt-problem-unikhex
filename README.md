## *Description*
This is semi group project. Its function is to automise a problem that the members of the group faced on a daily basis. 

## *The problem*
Our thought process was to create an app or a website that sends notification to a certain email adress or a number to first remind them to eat while at the same time sending easy to cokk food recipes for the type of meal they are going to eat. 

## *How am i going to fix it*
I am personlising it to make it so that it only sends notifications for breakfast and supper. I also wanted mine to only be able to send recipes for only ingredients that i currernly have.

## *Language/ Built with*

Python 3.9

Markdown

Maybe some more (to be added later).

## *How it functions*
At this point in time i havn't decided that if its going to be a website or an easy to build app.
