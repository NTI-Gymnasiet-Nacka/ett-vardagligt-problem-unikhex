## *Description*
This is semi group project. Its function is to automise a problem that the members of the group faced on a daily basis. 

## *The problem*
The primary purpose of your platform is to remind users to eat and provide them with easy-to-cook recipes. 
Our thought process was to create an app or a website that sends notification to a certain email adress or a number to first remind them to eat while at the same time sending easy to cokk food recipes for the type of meal they are going to eat. 

## *How am i going to fix it*
I am personlising it to make it so that it only sends notifications for breakfast and supper. I also wanted mine to only be able to send recipes for only ingredients that i currernly have.

## *What it has to have*
I'll try to integrate a notification system: Develop a notification system that sends reminders to the user's email or phone number. I could use third-party APIs like Twilio to send SMS notifications or email notifications.

Choose or input ingridients needed.


## *What woul be good to have*
A recipe database: Here i can either create my recipe database or use third-party APIs like Spoonacular or Edamam. I just have to make sure to have a wide variety of recipes for different types of meals, such as breakfast, lunch, dinner, and snacks.

A good design the user interface that is easy to navigate and user-friendly. I'll try to make sure to include features like the ability to search for recipes, save favorite recipes, and set reminders for meal times.
User registation.

A user being able to save their favorite recipes.

May be include a functional search bar.

## *Language/ Built with*

Python 3.9

Markdown

Maybe some more (to be added later).

## *How it functions*
At this point in time i havn't decided that if its going to be a website or an easy to build app.
